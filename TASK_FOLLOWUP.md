# TASK_FOLLOWUP — the live step log (read right after CLAUDE.md)

Keep this file SHORT (under 60 lines): every session loads it whole. Newest
log line on top; past ~10 lines move the oldest to
`docs/history/TASK_FOLLOWUP_archive_2026-10-13_to_2026-11-12.md`. Times Dubai.

## Current task — Windows GPU load: mostly done (commit 4 in Windows app)

`Rafiq-Al-Darb-Windows/app` (windows-desktop), measured 2026-11-12/13,
Get-Counter 3D mean: hidden 91.1% -> 2.7-5.5%; visible 94.7% -> ~45%
(frames 52/s -> ~19/s). Fixes: TickerMode on hidden window + hidden
IndexedStack tabs, RGB backdrop timer 5/s, clock timer, focus-ring ticker.
Remaining visible load = PrayerCountdown seconds roll (owner-designed) at
~20 ms raster per full-window frame.

## Next step (exact)

Optional: cut the ~20 ms raster per frame (find the heavy layer: blur/shadow/
photo; RepaintBoundary round PrayerCountdown). Android has the same hidden-tab
ticker leak (IndexedStack + Qibla `repeat()`): port the TickerMode fix to
`rafeeq_app/` only if the owner agrees (battery win). Pre-existing failing
Windows tests: method_channel_names, notification_id_ranges.

## Standing owner orders (still open)

- NO release without the owner's word. Last published: v4.3.0
  (2026-11-12 ~23:20, tag 7630abac, versionCode 120).
- `scripts/own_irab/SPECIALIST_SAMPLE.csv`: 300 words for a human grammarian;
  the app may not call the i'rab «معتمد» before that result.
- Hourly autorun `own-irab-autorun` stays DISABLED.

## Half-done / unverified

- v4.3.0 on a real phone: Android 10+ «السماح طوال الوقت» screen, the card
  following a real trip, the city name from the phone's Geocoder (emulator
  gave none).
- Khatma (d5ef5d8a): rub' tap on the PRINTED page, share with
  translation/tafsir, non-Arabic UI, landscape, reminder firing unseen.
- Rafeeq voice assistant background fix; Google book voice (v3.99.0): not on
  a device.
- Adhan retry fix: API 36 only. Per-ABI APKs: ARM phone pending.
- «إشعار منبثق فقط» heads-up not seen on Android 8+.
- Emulator Rafeeq_Audit_API24 left in ENGLISH UI, card mode «elapsed».
